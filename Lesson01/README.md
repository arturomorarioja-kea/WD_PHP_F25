[PHP - Spring 2025]([https://github.com/arturomorarioja-kea/WD_UX_F25/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/arturomorarioja-kea/WD_PHP_F25/edit/main/README.md))

# Lesson 1 - 4 February

## Software you need
**An IDE**

I will use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [PHP Intellephense](https://intelephense.com/) extension for syntax help and code completion.

**A LAMP/MAMP/WAMP distribution**

Use one that works in your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). It must include:
- Apache Web Server (2.4 or higher recommended)
- PHP (8.0 or higher. I will use 8.2)
- MySQL or MariaDB

These are some of the most popular distributions:
- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) (Windows, Mac, and Linux)
- MAMP ([Windows](https://www.mamp.info/en/windows/) and [Mac](https://www.mamp.info/en/mac/))
- [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/) (Windows)
- [AMPPS](https://ampps.com/) (Windows, Mac, and Linux). It includes MongoDB
- [EasyPHP](https://www.easyphp.org/index.php) (Windows)
I will use XAMPP for Windows, but Mac users normally prefer MAMP. 

*Alternative #1*

You can install the three tools individually:
- [Apache Web Server](https://httpd.apache.org/download.cgi)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads.php)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

*Alternative #2*

[Create a Docker LAMP](https://quileswest.medium.com/creating-a-docker-lamp-linux-apache-php-mysql-stack-111ad3fb9d56).

**PHP’s dependency manager**

Like npm for JavaScript or pip for Python. Its name is [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

**A MySQL/MariaDB administration tool**

Most distributions already include [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) (XAMPP and MAMP certainly do), but better check it out.

*Alternative #1*

Some developers prefer other tools like [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) or [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/).

*Alternative #2*

Use the CLI. It will help you improve your relational database management skills.

**An API platform**

I will use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), but you can also try [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), [Hopscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/), Visual Studio Code’s [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/) or any other similar one.

**And, of course…**

Source code management: [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and an online repository platform. I will use [GitHub](https://github.com/), but feel free to use [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/product/) or similar.
